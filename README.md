 ## Setup

 In order for HopenRXRTools TR Master to run, it requires the Python Engine.

 HopenRXRTools TR Master will run on Windows 10 and 11 computers.

1. First, download Python 3.0 from the offical python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

 MAKE SURE TO SPECIFICALLY DOWNLOAD "Windows installer (64-bit)" FOR VERSIONS 3.12.0 OR ABOVE OR PILLOW WILL NOT INSTALL!

2. Next, download the HopenRXRTools "Source code (Zip)" from the [releases](https://github.com/Hopen111/HopenRXRTools/releases) tab on the right.

3. Once downloaded, extract the folder.

4. Check if Python installed correctly by running a script in the HopenRXRTools folder called "Empty Temporary Folder Junk"

 You should be able to easily run Python scripts by double left clicking. 

 This will remove some temporary "junk" .txt files from all folders (This exists so GitHub will allow me to upload empty folders)

 If you open the folders and the junk .txt files are removed, this means Python has installed correctly!

 If there was an error, reinstall Python. If that doesn't work, try contacting me on Discord (Username: "Hopen111").

 If all goes well, it should be able to run the scripts without any errors.

 Now, you are done!

 ## Making Crossing Pages

 Since we have already set up the program (Hopefully), now we can begin making crossing pages!

 First, insert an HTML file into the "Input" folder. 

 Next, run the correct script. If there's 3 cities on each row then run the 3 row edition, and if there's 4 run the 4 row edition.

 Once you have filled out the info the new HTML file will be in the "Output" folder.
